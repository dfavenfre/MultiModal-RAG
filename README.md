|Show the chart where the relationship between CPI and GDP deflator used for calculating inflation rate| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b119956-ed06-466e-89fc-1aef8dd9a1e6) | The chart provided shows the relationship between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP deflator in calculating the inflation rate from 1960 to 2010. The inflation rates computed using either the CPI or the GDP deflator are largely similar, as indicated by the close movement of the two lines over the years. The CPI is represented by the blue line, while the GDP deflator is represented by the pink line.|  0:00:05.817202|
